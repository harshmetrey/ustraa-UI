Ustra Assignment 

Steps to run the project 
  1. Clone the project using HTTPS 
      -> open Terminal 
      -> git clone https://github.com/harshmetrey/ustraa-UI.git
      -> cd ustraa-UI
      -> npm install (assuming NPM and node are already install on the system)
      -> after all the devepencies are installed 'npm start'
      
  2. The layout is made for mobile devices.
      ->  I have removed all the warings from the terminal so you can view the On Your Network url to directly access the project on mobile browsers
